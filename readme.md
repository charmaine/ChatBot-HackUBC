# Building Intelligent Bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Software bots are everywhere. You probably interact with them every day without realizing it. Bots, especially chat and messenger bots, are changing the way we interact with businesses, communities, and even each other. Thanks to light-speed advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the ready availability of AI services, bots are not only becoming more advanced and personalized, but also more accessible to developers. 

Regardless of the target language or platform, developers building bots face the same challenges. Bots must be able process input and output intelligently. Bots need to be responsive, scalable, and extensible. They need to work cross-platform, and they need to interact with users in a conversational manner and in the language the user chooses.

The [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), combined with [Microsoft QnA Maker](https://qnamaker.ai/), provides the tools developers need to build and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally with users using a range of services. In this lab, you will create a bot using Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft Bot Framework, and connect it to a knowledge base built with QnA Maker. Then you will interact with the bot using Skype â€” one of many popular services with which bots built with the Microsoft Bot Framework can integrate.

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Bot Service ##

The first step in creating a bot is to provide a location for the bot to be hosted, as well as configuring the services that the bot will use. [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) are perfect for hosting bot applications, and the Azure Bot Service is designed to provision and connect these services for you. In this exercise, you will create and configure an Azure Bot Service.

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser. If you are asked to sign in, do so using your Microsoft account.

1. Click **+ New**, followed by **Intelligence + analytics** and then **Bot Service (preview)**.
 
    ![Creating a new Azure Bot Service](Images/portal-new-bot-service.png)

    _Creating a new Azure Bot Service_
  
1. Enter a name such as "qnafactbot" (without quotation marks) into the **App name** box. *This name must be unique within Azure, so make sure a green check mark appears next to it.* Make sure **Create new** is selected under **Resource Group** and enter the resource-group name "BotsResourceGroup" (again, without quotation marks). Then select the location nearest you and click **Create**. 

    ![Configuring a new Azure Bot Service](Images/portal-create-new-bot-service.png)

    _Pasting the app password_
  
1. Click **NodeJS**. Then click **Question and Answer** and click **Create bot**. If you are asked to sign in again, do so using your Microsoft account. Also, if you are asked for permission for QnA Maker to access your info, click **Yes**.

    ![Selecting a language and template](Images/portal-select-template.png)

    _Selecting a language and template_

1. Check the **I agree** box, and then click **OK**. (If you are presented with the option of connecting to an existing knowledge base or creating a new one, choose the latter.) 

    ![Connecting to QnA Maker](Images/connect-bot-to-qnamaker.png)

    _Connecting to QnA Maker_
  
1. After a brief pause, the Bot Service will open in the portal and display the Bot Service editor, as pictured below. Behind the scenes, the bot has been registered, an Azure Web App has been created to host it, and the bot has been connected to Microsoft QnA Maker.

    ![The Bot Service editor](Images/portal-editor-new.png)

    _The Bot Service editor_  

1. To make sure these services can communicate with each other, you can test bot communication in the Azure Bot Service editor. To test, type the word "hi" (without quotation marks) into the chat window on the right side of the page. Then press **Enter** or click the paper-airplane icon.

    ![Testing bot communication](Images/portal-send-chat-test.png)

    _Testing bot communication_

1. Wait for the bot to respond with the word "hello," indicating your bot is configured and ready to go.

    ![Chatting with your bot](Images/portal-test-chat.png)

    _Chatting with your bot_

With the Bot Service deployed and configured, the next step is to update the Microsoft QnA Maker service that the bot is connected to.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Get started with Microsoft QnA Maker ##

[Microsoft QnA Maker](https://qnamaker.ai/) is part of [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/), which is a suite of APIs for building intelligent apps. Rather than infuse a bot with intelligence by writing code that tries to anticipate every question a user might ask and provide a response, you can connect it to a knowledge base of questions and answers created with QnA Maker. A common usage scenario is to create a knowledge base from a FAQ so the bot can answer domain-specific questions such as "How do I find my Windows product key" or "Where can I download Visual Studio Code?"

In this exercise, you will use the QnA Maker portal to edit the knowledge base that was created when you connected the bot to QnA Maker. That knowledge base currently contains a single question and answer: "hi" and "hello." You will edit the response and then, in [Exercise 3](#Exercise3), populate the knowledge base with additional questions and answers.

1. Open the [Microsoft QnA Maker portal](https://qnamaker.ai/) in your browser. If you are not signed in, click **Sign in** in the upper-right corner and sign in with your Microsoft account. If you are presented with a terms agreement, check the **I agree** box and continue. 

    ![Signing in to QnA Maker](Images/qna-click-signin.png)

    _Signing in to QnA Maker_

1. Ensure that **My services** is selected at the top. Then click the pencil icon.
 
    ![Editing a QnA service](Images/qna-click-edit-icon.png)

    _Editing a QnA service_

1. Click **Settings**. Replace the value in the **Service name** box with "QnA Factbot" (without quotation marks). Then click **Save and retrain** to save the change. 
 
    ![Updating the service name](Images/qna-save-service-name.png)

    _Updating the service name_

1. Click **Knowledge Base**.
 
    ![Opening the Knowledge Base page](Images/qna-select-kb-tab.png)

    _Opening the Knowledge Base page_

1. Replace "hello" in the Answer column with "Welcome to the QnA Factbot!" Then click **Save and retrain** to save the change. 
 
    ![Updating a response](Images/qna-update-default-answer.png)

    _Updating a response_

1. Click **Test**.
 
    ![Opening the Test page](Images/qna-select-test-tab.png)

    _Opening the Test page_

1. Type "hi" into the box at the bottom of the chat window and press **Enter**. Confirm that the bot responds with "Welcome to the QnA Factbot!"
 
    ![Chatting with the bot](Images/qna-updated-chat-response.png)

    _Chatting with the bot_

This is a great start, but a simple reply to the greeting "hi" doesn't demonstrate a lot of value. To give your bot some meaningful content to work with, the next step is to populate the knowledge base with additional questions and answers.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Expand the QnA Maker knowledge base ##

You can enter questions and answers into a QnA Maker knowledge base manually, or you can import them from a variety of sources, including Web sites and local text files. In this exercise, you will use both of these techniques to populate the knowledge base with questions and answers and then publish the updated knowledge base for your bot to use.

1. Click **Settings** to the return to the Settings page in the [Microsoft QnA Maker portal](https://qnamaker.ai/).
 
    ![Opening the Settings page](Images/qna-select-settings-tab.png)

    _Opening the Settings page_

1. Paste the your favorite FAQ URLs into the **URLs** box:

	```
	https://traininglabservices.azurewebsites.net/help/faqs.html
	https://giraffeconservation.org/faqs/
	http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/faq.asp
	```

1. Click **Save and retrain** to populate the knowledge base with questions and answers from the Web site whose URL you provided.
 
    ![Importing questions and answers from a URL](Images/qna-add-faq-url.png)

    _Importing questions and answers from a URL_

1. Click **Knowledge Base** and confirm that six new questions and answers were added. Then click **Save and retrain** to save the changes.

    ![The updated knowledge base](Images/qna-updated-kb-01.png)

    _The updated knowledge base_

1. Click **Test** to return to the Test page. Type "What's the largest city in the world?" into the box at the bottom of the chat window and press **Enter**. Confirm that the bot responds as shown below.
 
    ![Testing the updated knowledge base](Images/qna-test-largest-city.png)

    _Testing the updated knowledge base_

1. The knowledge base only contains a few questions and answers, but can easily be updated to include more. You can even import questions and answers stored in text files on your computer. To demonstrate, click **Replace Knowledge Base** in the upper-left corner of the portal.
 
    ![Replacing the knowledge base](Images/qna-click-replace-kb.png)

    _Replacing the knowledge base_

1. Browse to the "Resources" folder included with this lab and select the text file named **Final QnA.txt**. Click **OK** when prompted to confirm that importing this file will overwrite existing questions and answers.
 
1. Click **Knowledge Base** and confirm that 14 new questions and answers appear in the knowledge base. (The six you imported from the URL are still there, despite the fact that you were warned that they would be overwritten.) Then click **Save and retrain** to save the changes.

    ![The updated knowledge base](Images/qna-updated-kb-02.png)

    _The updated knowledge base_

1. Click **Test** to return to the Test page. Type "What book has sold the most copies?" into the box at the bottom of the chat window and press **Enter**. Confirm that the bot responds as shown below. 
 
    ![Chatting with the bot](Images/qna-test-book.png)

    _Chatting with the bot_

1. Click **Publish** to publish the changes to the knowledge base.
 
    ![Publishing the knowledge base](Images/qna-click-publish.png)

    _Publishing the knowledge base_


With our  knowledge base deployed, it is now time to lend attention to the bot itself.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
## Exercise 4: Deploy the bot to a website ##
When you deployed a Bot Service in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1), an Azure Web App was created to host the bot. But the bot still needs to be written and deployed to the Azure Web app. In this exercise, you will code the bot using source code generated for you by QnA Maker. 

1. In Azure, create a new Web App

	![Create Empty Web App](https://i.imgur.com/mgQmane.png)

1. Navigate to the App Service Editor within your web app  & **GO** into editing
	
	![App Service Editor](https://i.imgur.com/EBRJlwJ.png)

1. Create a new file called `index.html` - this will be our website homepage
	![new file](https://i.imgur.com/0acXM8I.png)
	![index.html](https://i.imgur.com/qofLCdS.png)

1. Paste the following code into `index.html`

	```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<body>
    <iframe src='https://webchat.botframework.com/embed/SERVICE-NAME?s=SECRET-KEY-REDACTED'width="50%" height="400px" margin-top="-200px"</iframe>
  	</body>
	</html>
	```

	**LEAVE THIS TAB OPEN**

1. **IN A NEW TAB go** to the Azure Portal and open the Bot Service you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1) if it isn't already open.

    ![Opening the Bot Service](Images/portal-click-bot-service.png)

    _Opening the Bot Service_
  
1. Click **CHANNELs**, and then click **Edit** on your WebApp.

<a name="Exercise5"></a>
## Exercise 5: Test the bot with Skype ##

Once deployed, bots can be connected to channels such as Skype, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Facebook Messenger, where you can interact with them the way you would interact with any other user. In this exercise, you will test your bot with Skype.

1. If Skype isn't already installed on your computer, please install it now. You can download Skype for Windows, macOS, and Linux from https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/.

1. Return to your Bot Service in the Azure Portal and click **Channels**. 

    ![Opening the Channels page](Images/portal-bot-channel-tab.png)

    _Opening the Channels page_
 
1. Click **Edit** in the "Skype" row.

    ![Editing the Skype channel](Images/portal-edit-skype.png)

    _Editing the Skype channel_
 
1. Ensure that the bot is enabled on Skype and click **I'm done configuring** at the bottom of the page. Your bot is now ready to test in a Skype conversation.

    ![Enabling Skype integration](Images/portal-enable-skype.png)

    _Enabling Skype integration_
 
1. Click the **Add to Skype** button.
 
    ![Adding the bot to Skype](Images/portal-click-add-to-skype.png)

    _Adding the bot to Skype_
 
1.  Click **Add to Contacts** to add the bot as a Skype contact. Skype will launch and display a new conversation thread between you and the bot. 
  
	> If Skype does not automatically initiate a conversation with the bot, select the bot from the "Recent" list in Skype to initiate a conversation manually. 
	
    ![Adding the bot as a Skype contact](Images/skype-add-to-contacts.png)

    _Adding the bot as a Skype contact_
	
1. Start a conversation with the bot by typing "hi" into the Skype window.The bot will display a welcome message and you can start a question-and-answer process using the information available in your QnA knowledge base!   	
 
    ![Chatting with the bot in Skype](Images/skype-responses.png)

    _Chatting with the bot in Skype_

You now have a fully functional bot created with the Microsoft Bot Framework, infused with intellgience with Microsoft QnA Maker, and available for anyone in the world to interact with. Feel free to plug your bot into other channels and test it in different scenarios. And if you would like to make the bot smarter, consider expanding the QnA knowledge base with additional questions and answers. For example, you could use the [online FAQ](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/faq/) for the Bot Framework to train the bot to answer questions about the framework itself.

<a name="Summary"></a>
## Summary ##

In this hands-on lab you learned how to:

- Create an Azure Bot Service to host a bot
- Create a Microsoft QnA knowledge base, populate it with data, and connect it to a bot
- Implement bots in code and debug the bots that you build
- Plug a bot into Skype and interact with it there

There is much more that you can do to leverage the power of the Microsoft Bot Framework by incorporating [dialogs](http://aihelpwebsite.com/Blog/EntryId/9/Introduction-To-Using-Dialogs-With-The-Microsoft-Bot-Framework), [FormFlow](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/07/14/building-a-microsoft-bot-using-microsoft-bot-framework-using-formflow/), and [Microsoft Language Understanding and Intelligence Services (LUIS)](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/guides/understanding-natural-language/). With these and other features, you can build sophisticated bots that respond to users' queries and commands and interact in a fluid, conversational, and non-linear manner.
